# Automatic-License-Plate-Detection
In this project, transfer learning using Maaked-RCNN is used to detect license plates in Indian motorcycles and 2-wheelers. For more details on using Mak-RCNN in keras, please go [here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/06/10/keras-mask-r-cnn/).  

A manual dataset of 1227 Indian 2-wheelers on highways and parking lots is created (some augmentation used). All these are manually annotated using VGG annotator to determine license place segments. The annotations are saved in a file called Plates-config.json. The dataset is divided into 80-20 train-validation. The model is trained using train.py for 8 epochs. The model is present in model.py with config.py being the configuration file. After the training is complete, the model the license plate detection and segmentation code can be found in test.py. test.py also contains two methods to perform license number recognition- tesseractOCR and KNN. While detection and segmentation is highly accurate, recognition is poor.
